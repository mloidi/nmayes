        <p>
          I'm a web developer currently located in Pamplona Spain. You know, the
          running of the bulls. When Iâ€™m not running with them, my main focus is
          to developing new web technologies. In my free time, I am constantly
          experimenting with new projects, pushing my skills to adapt the latest
          web tech to build new web designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about development and design. On the frontend, I work
          mainly with React while on the backend I work with Node and Express.
          As for a data base I prefer to use MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a growing community, the web industry is one that I have learned so
          much from and hope to give back just as much. I am mostly excited
          about the future of this industry. There is so much we have yet to
          discover, and I cannot wait to see what is coming next.
        </p>
